# Wildfires Data Visualization

This project showcases my experience with the D3.js JavaScript library for creating interactive and dynamic data visualizations. 

> *"D3 (or D3.js) is a free, open-source JavaScript library for visualizing data. Its low-level approach built on web standards offers unparalleled flexibility in authoring dynamic, data-driven graphics."* â€” D3.js Official Documentation

For this project, I implemented a visualization mapping of France, using wildfire data sourced from official government datasets.

## Try the Visualization

You can explore the visualization on my portfolio: [Wildfires Data Visualization](https://smarsou.fr/lab/viz).

While the current design may require enhancements, this demo demonstrates the powerful capabilities of D3.js for data-driven storytelling.

## Project Documentation

Comprehensive documentation for this project is available in the file *DV - project template.docx.pdf*. This document provides insights into my approach and the steps taken to complete the project.

The report includes detailed sections on:
- **Data Collection**: Identifying and gathering relevant wildfire data from trusted government sources.
- **Data Cleaning and Transformation**: Preparing the dataset for analysis and visualization by addressing inconsistencies and formatting issues.
- **Visualization Strategies**: Designing and implementing an interactive map to effectively communicate insights.
